## The Data-Fidelity Term in Linear Inverse Problems

In some of our recent works, we investigate the role of the data-fidelity term in solving linear inverse problems. Most often in linear inverse problems, the $\ell_2$-norm is used to compute the error between the measurements and the measurement model. Consider the measurement model:
{: .text-justify}

<div style="text-align: center;">
$y = Ax + w.$
<br><br>
</div>

Here, $A$ is the forward operator (or sensing matrix) that describes the measurement process, and $w$ represents measurement noise. Since $A$ is often ill-conditioned or rectangular (with fewer measurements than signal dimensions), the problem is ill-posed and requires regularization to find a meaningful solution.
{: .text-justify}

The standard approach is to solve an optimization problem with the $\ell_2$-norm as the data-fidelity metric:
{: .text-justify}

<div style="text-align: center;">
$\min_{x} \frac{1}{2} \|Ax - y\|_2^2 + \lambda g(x)$
<br><br>
</div>

Although this choice has statistical backing, i.e., the $\ell_2$-norm is a direct consequence of modelling additive noise as a Gaussian random variable in maximum a posteriori estimation, it is often not the best choice in practice <d-cite key="gribonval2021bayesian"></d-cite>.

## Introduction to Frames

In linear algebra, a basis for a vector space is a set of linearly independent vectors that span the space. This means any vector in the space can be written as a *unique* linear combination of the basis vectors. Frames are a generalization of bases that provide more flexibility. A frame is a set of vectors that also spans the space but is not required to be linearly independent. This redundancy can be highly beneficial for robustness to noise and errors.
{: .text-justify}

Formally, a set of $N$ vectors $\lbrace v_i \in \mathbb{R}^n \rbrace_{i=1}^N$ is said to constitute a **frame** for $\mathbb{R}^n$ if there exist constants $0 < \alpha \le \beta < \infty$ such that for any vector $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$, the following condition holds:
{: .text-justify}

<div style="text-align: center;">
$\alpha \|x\|_2^2 \le \sum_{i=1}^{N} |\langle x, v_i \rangle|^2 \le \beta \|x\|_2^2$
<br><br>
</div>

The constants $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are called the frame bounds.

If the frame bounds are equal, $\alpha = \beta$, the frame is called a **tight frame**. If $\alpha = \beta = 1$, it is a **Parseval tight frame**. Tight frames share some of the desirable properties of orthonormal bases, making them particularly useful in areas like compressed sensing.

## The Back-Projection Loss as a Distance Minimization

The back-projection loss is defined as the squared distance from a candidate solution $x$ to the solution space of the measurement model. Let's define the solution space (in the noiseless case) as the affine subspace $C = \lbrace z \in \mathbb{R}^n : Az = y\rbrace$. This set contains all possible signals that are perfectly consistent with the measurements $y$.
{: .text-justify}

The squared Euclidean distance from a point $x$ to this set is given by:

<div style="text-align: center;">
$d_C^2(x) = \min_{z \in C} \|x - z\|_2^2$
<br><br>
</div>

The point in $C$ closest to $x$ is the orthogonal projection of $x$ onto $C$, denoted as $\text{proj}_C(x)$. For a full row-rank matrix $A$, this projection is given by:
{: .text-justify}

<div style="text-align: center;">
$\text{proj}_C(x) = x - A^{\dagger}(Ax - y)$
<br><br>
</div>

where $A^{\dagger} = A^T(AA^T)^{-1}$ is the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of $A$. Therefore, the squared distance is:
{: .text-justify}

<div style="text-align: center;">
$d_C^2(x) = \|x - \text{proj}_C(x)\|_2^2 = \|A^{\dagger}(Ax - y)\|_2^2$
<br><br>
</div>

The back-projection loss is precisely this squared distance. The optimization problem then becomes:
{: .text-justify}

<div style="text-align: center;">
$\min_{x} \frac{1}{2} \|A^{\dagger}(y - Ax)\|_2^2 + \lambda g(x)$
<br><br>
</div>

This formulation seeks a solution that is not only regularized by $g(x)$ but is also minimally distant from the space of all signals that could have produced the measurements. Such a choice has been shown to provide superior reconstruction accuracy for inverse problems in imaging <d-cite key="tirer2021convergence"></d-cite>, compressive sensing <d-cite key="nareddy2024tight"></d-cite>, and finite-rate-of-innovation signal reconstruction <d-cite key="kamath2025deepfri"></d-cite>.

## Back-Projection and Tight Frames in Compressed Sensing

In compressed sensing (CS), the goal is to recover a sparse signal from a few measurements. The choice of the sensing matrix $A$ is critical. While random Gaussian matrices are easy to construct and satisfy theoretical guarantees like the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), **tight-frame** matrices are known to yield the minimum mean-squared error. A matrix $V$ is a Parseval tight frame if $VV^\top = I$.
{: .text-justify}

### Minimum MSE Recovery with an Oracle

To understand why tight frames are optimal, consider an idealized scenario where an "oracle" tells us the exact locations (the support, denoted by $S$) of the non-zero entries in the sparse signal $x$. The recovery problem then simplifies to finding the *values* of these non-zero coefficients.
{: .text-justify}

Let $x_S$ be the vector of non-zero values of $x$ and $A_S$ be the submatrix of $A$ containing only the columns indexed by the support $S$. The measurement model becomes:
{: .text-justify}

<div style="text-align: center;">
$y = A_S x_S + w$
<br><br>
</div>

This is a standard linear estimation problem. The best linear unbiased estimator for $x_S$ is the least-squares solution, which gives the recovered values $\hat{x}_S$:
{: .text-justify}

<div style="text-align: center;">
$\hat{x}_S = (A_S^T A_S)^{-1} A_S^T y$.
<br><br>
</div>

The mean-squared error (MSE) of this estimate is directly related to the properties of the matrix $(A_S^T A_S)^{-1}$. The error is minimized when this matrix is well-conditioned. A **tight-frame** sensing matrix $A$ ensures that for any support $S$, the columns of $A_S$ are as close to orthogonal as possible, which makes $A_S^T A_S$ well-conditioned (close to the identity matrix). This minimizes the amplification of the noise $w$ during the recovery process, thus achieving the minimum possible MSE.
{: .text-justify}

### The Back-Projection Bridge

The back-projection loss provides a remarkable bridge between the convenience of random matrices and the optimality of tight frames. Consider the standard CS problem formulation with a non-tight sensing matrix $A$ (e.g., Gaussian) and the back-projection loss:
{: .text-justify}

<div style="text-align: center;">
$\min_{x} \|D^\top x\|_1 \quad \text{subject to} \quad \|A^{\dagger}(y - Ax)\|_2 \le \epsilon$,
<br><br>
</div>

where $D$ is a sparsifying dictionary. This is equivalent to solving the problem with a modified data-fidelity term $\Vert B(Ax-y)\Vert^2_2$ where $B=(AA^T)^{-1/2}$.

This formulation is equivalent to solving the original problem with an *effective* sensing matrix $\tilde{A} = BA = (AA^T)^{-1/2}A$ and effective measurements $\tilde{y} = By$. The key insight is that this new sensing matrix $\tilde{A}$ is a **Parseval tight frame**, because:
{: .text-justify}

<div style="text-align: center;">
$\tilde{A}\tilde{A}^T = (BA)(BA)^T = BAA^TB^T = (AA^T)^{-1/2}AA^T(AA^T)^{-1/2} = I$.
<br><br>
</div>

This means that by simply changing the data-fidelity loss to the back-projection loss, we can gain the performance benefits of a tight-frame sensing matrix without the difficulty of constructing one. This leads to improved recovery guarantees, especially when the number of measurements is low or the signal is less sparse.
{: .text-justify}

## A Wiener-Filter-like Update for Image Deconvolution

When the forward model $A$ represents a convolution, such as in image deblurring, the back-projection loss has another elegant interpretation. In iterative optimization algorithms like the proximal gradient method, the update step involves computing the gradient of the data-fidelity term.
{: .text-justify}

For the standard least-squares loss, the gradient is $\nabla f_{LS}(x) = A^T(Ax-y)$. For the back-projection loss, the gradient is $\nabla f_{BP}(x) = A^T(AA^T)^{-1}(Ax-y)$.
{: .text-justify}

In practice, the matrix $AA^T$ can be ill-conditioned, so a regularized inverse is used. For a convolutional operator $H$, the gradient update becomes:
{: .text-justify}

<div style="text-align: center;">
$\nabla f_{BP}(x) = H^T(HH^T + \epsilon I)^{-1}(Hx - y)$
<br><br>
</div>

This expression is precisely the form of a **Wiener filter**. In the Fourier domain, if $\mathcal{F}(\cdot)$ is the Fourier transform, the operator $H^T(HH^T + \epsilon I)^{-1}$ becomes a filter with the frequency response:
{: .text-justify}

<div style="text-align: center;">
$\displaystyle\frac{\overline{\mathcal{F}(h)}}{|\mathcal{F}(h)|^2 + \epsilon}$,
<br><br>
</div>

where $h$ is the blur kernel. This filter adaptively de-emphasizes frequencies that were attenuated by the blur, preventing noise amplification. Therefore, using the back-projection loss in a convolutional setting is akin to incorporating a Wiener-filter-like deconvolution step directly into the gradient update of the optimization, leading to more stable and accurate reconstructions.
{: .text-justify}

## Solving Inverse Problems with the Method of Alternating Proximations

This optimization problem can be solved efficiently using the **proximal gradient method (PGM)**. PGM is an iterative algorithm designed for problems that are a sum of a smooth function and a (possibly non-smooth) function for which we can compute a proximal operator.

In our case, the objective function is $f(x) + h(x)$, where $f(x) = \frac{1}{2} \Vert A^{\dagger}(y - Ax)\Vert_2^2$ is the smooth data-fidelity term, and $h(x) = \lambda g(x)$ is the regularization term.

The gradient of the smooth part is:

<div style="text-align: center;">
$\nabla f(x) = A^T(AA^T)^{-1}(Ax-y) = A^{\dagger}(Ax-y)$
<br><br>
</div>

The PGM update step is given by:

<div style="text-align: center;">
$x_{k+1} = \text{prox}_{h}(x_k - \nabla f(x_k))$,
<br>
$x_{k+1} = \text{prox}_{\lambda g}(x_k - A^{\dagger}(Ax_k-y))$.
<br><br>
</div>

Notice that the term inside the proximal operator is exactly the projection of $x_k$ onto the solution space $C$:

<div style="text-align: center;">
$x_k - A^{\dagger}(Ax_k-y) = \text{proj}_C(x_k)$
<br><br>
</div>

This allows us to write the update in a very intuitive form:

<div style="text-align: center;">
$x_{k+1} = \text{prox}_{\lambda g}(\text{prox}_{\iota_C}(x_k))$
<br><br>
</div>

The iterative scheme that follows the proximal gradient method can also be viewed from the perspective of **alternating approximations** <d-cite key="kamath2024method"></d-cite>.
{: .text-justify}

Empirically, it was observed that the method of alternating proximations provided faster and superior-quality reconstructions compared to the standard least-squares data-fidelity for compressive sensing <d-cite key="nareddy2024tight"></d-cite> and image deconvolution <d-cite key="nareddy2024image"></d-cite>.
