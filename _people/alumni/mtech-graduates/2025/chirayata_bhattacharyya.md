biography_paragraphs: "Chirayata hails from Kolkata, and loves mostly all the things about stochastic systems, literature and econmics. He did his B.E. in Electronics and Telecommunication ENgineering from Jadavpur University and worked a couple of years at TCS Research before coming to IISc. He was a student of M. Tech Signal Processing, loved all of his courses more than the serenity of the campus greens. You can find him reading, acting or taking photos when he is not tuning ML models, and if you do, grab him, head over to have coffee and connect over mutual interests."
