2. Research Expertise and Selected Publications in the Past Five Years

My research expertise lies in Computational Imaging, Generative AI, and Artiﬁcial Intelligence/Machine Learning
with primary focus on Healthcare applications and emphasis on explainability and interpretability. Over the past
decade, our research has focused on advancing the state of the art and breaking fundamental limits in these
areas, as demonstrated by the publication record. My major strength is in encapsulating and formulating real-

world problems arising in various contexts in the ﬁelds of biomedical imaging, neuroscience, neuroimaging,
speech processing, computer vision, etc. and developing practically viable strategies and computationally
efficient algorithms supported on a strong and sound mathematical formulation. This core competency has
enabled me to seamlessly navigate across various application areas. As evidenced by the publications in
premier venues, we have developed original formalisms and techniques in diverse problem settings.

The following is a selected list of international peer-reviewed publications in the past ﬁve years. Each

publication is accompanied by a brief description of the contribution and the impact of the publication.



                                                                                                               3

    fundus images,” Proceedings of Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI)
    Challenge on Ultra-wideﬁeld Fundus Imaging for Diabetic Retinopaty, Lecture Notes in Computer Science,
    Springer, pp. 135-143, October 2024.
    — We address the MICCAI challenge of optimizing the performance of a detector for diabetic retinopathy (DR)

    from ultra-wideﬁeld fundus images, focusing on balancing model accuracy and latency. This MICCAI
    challenge prioritized “area under the receiver operating characteristic curve” (AUROC) and central
    processing unit (CPU) time for the detection problem. We proposed EfficientNet-B1 for solving this problem
    and it gave a high AUROC value of 0.9055 on the UWF4DR test dataset while maintaining a minimal forward
    pass time.


2. Kartheek K. Nareddy, A. J. Kamath, and C. S. Seelamantula, “Tight-frame-like analysis-sparse recovery using
    nontight sensing matrices,” vol. 17, iss. 3, SIAM Journal on Imaging Sciences, 2024. (IF: 2.1)
    — Random Gaussian sensing matrices satisfy the restricted isometry property, which is crucial for solving
    the sparse recovery problem using convex optimization techniques. However,  tight-frame sensing
    matrices result in minimum mean-squared-error recovery given oracle knowledge of the support of the

    sparse vector. If the sensing matrix is not tight, could one achieve the recovery performance assured by a
    tight frame by suitably designing the recovery strategy?  This paper presents the theory and algorithms for
    performing successful sparse recovery using nontight sensing matrices.

    nanoscale precision using Neuromorphic localization microscopy,” Nature Nanotechnology. (IF: 40.523)

    — In this breakthrough invention, we showed how nanoscale ﬂuorescent objects can be imaged below the
    diffraction limit with a precision below 20 nm. This is the ﬁrst successful attempt that combines
    neuromorphic detection with computational deep learning approaches for localization and tracking with
    nanoscale precision and millisecond temporal resolution.

    Machine Learning Research (JMLR), vol. 24, pp. 1-100, 2023. (IF: 5.177)
    — In this mammoth 100-page publication, we rigorously investigated the functioning of generative
    adversarial networks from a variational standpoint and addressed the optimality of the discriminator. We
    established for the ﬁrst time that the optimal discriminator solves the Poisson partial differential equation
    (PDE), and solved the PDE in very high-dimensional spaces (typically, a million dimensions) using Fourier
    representations.

    Proceedings of IEEE Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2023. (h5-index: 389; IF: 23.46)
    — In this paper, we introduced a new generative model that transforms one dataset to another using a GAN
    instead of starting with random Gaussian noise. We also introduced a new distance metric to quantify
    proximity between datasets. The proposed generative model achieves accelerated convergence by an order

    of magnitude and produces state-of-the-art performance scores.

    averaging network for seismic reﬂectivity inversion," IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging, vol. 9,
    pp. 475-489, May 2023. (IF: 4.99)
    — This publication is the ﬁrst-of-its-kind successful attempt at using a sparsity driven, deep learning

    approach for computationally solving the inverse problem of seismic reﬂectivity imaging. Performance
    validation on Marmousi2 simulated model and 3-D real ﬁeld measurements from the Penobscot 3D survey
    off the coast of Nova Scotia, Canada show that the proposed approaches give superior accuracy with 600x
    faster inference than the state-of-the-art optimization algorithms, making it ideal for real-time seismic
    signal processing.

    and S. Patil, “Cháksu: A Glaucoma-speciﬁc fundus image database,” Nature Scientiﬁc Data. (IF: 8.9)
    — This paper is part of a large-scale translational effort in the context of “AI for Eyecare.” To make glaucoma
    diagnostics accurate and customized to the Indian population, we created an Indian ethnicity color fundus
    imaging database named Chákṣu comprising 1345 images acquired using three commercially available

    devices. Chákṣu is the largest Indian-ethnicity-speciﬁc fundus image database with expert annotations and
    would aid in the development of AI based glaucoma diagnostics.

   Seismological Society of America, vol. 112 (6), pp. 2847–2858, 2022. (IF: 3.14)
   — In this collaborative effort with leading earthscience researchers, we deployed powerful signal
   processing tools to analyze earthquake energy release duration and frequency content. We introduced a

   new, computationally efficient measure namely the “energy rate function” to quantify energy release. Based
   on real data from six earthquakes, we showed a strong correlation between the proposed measure to the
   benchmark moment rate function and source time function.

   Analysis and Machine Intelligence (PAMI), 2021, doi: 10.1109/TPAMI.2021.3122259. (IF: 24.314)
   — In this high-impact publication, we introduced a new nonconvex penalty, namely the minimax concave
   penalty for performing low-rank and sparse matrix decomposition. We presented computationally efficient
   algorithms with provable convergence guarantees and demonstrated applications to important computer
   vision problems.

   matrix decomposition approach,” Speech Communication, vol. 125, pp. 41-52, 2020. (IF: 2.723)
   — This paper demonstrates how the problem of musical noise suppression in speech enhancement
   techniques can be effectively solved using a low-rank and sparse matrix decomposition technique. This
   research is an incredible illustration of the cross-fertilization of ideas between image processing and

   speech processing.

11.S. Asokan and C. S. Seelamantula, “Teaching a GAN what not to learn,” Proceedings of Neural Information
   Processing Systems (NeurIPS), 2020. (h5 index: 309)
   — This paper builds a generative model based on what the famous Persian poet Rumi once said, “The art of
   knowing is knowing what to ignore.” A GAN is trained not only on positive samples that it must model, but

   also on negative samples that it must avoid. We showed that this new formulation of the generative model
   accelerates the learning capability of the GAN.

   Signal Processing Letters, vol. 27, pp. 1510-1514, 2020. (IF: 3.201)
   — This is the ﬁrst paper to demonstrate fringe projection proﬁlometry using a neuromorphic vision sensor.
   The sensors are asynchronous and event-driven and produce sparse measurements. In this paper, we

   showed how accurate 3-D reconstruction may be performed using neuromorphic measurements.

13.S. K. Shastri, S. Rudresh, R. Anand, S. Nagesh, C. S. Seelamantula, and A. K. Thittai, "Axial super-resolution in
   ultrasound imaging with application to non-destructive evaluation," vol. 108, no. 106183, Ultrasonics,
   December 2020. (IF: 4.062)
   — In this paper, we presented a systematic approach for achieving axial super-resolution in ultrasound

   imaging. We established the equivalence between ultrasound image reconstruction and sub-Nyquist
   sampling and presented an efficient model-based method for achieving super-resolution reconstruction
   three-fold below the theoretical resolution limit.

   superresolution ultrasound imaging," IEEE Signal Processing Letters, vol. 27, pp. 1060-1064, 2020. (IF:

   3.201)
   —    This paper demonstrates how two sparse subarrays could be used for performing computationally
   efficient convolutional beamforming without compromising on the beampattern and lateral resolution. The
   tools from abstract Minkowski algebra are leveraged for design of the subarray. The technique offers a
   signiﬁcant reduction in the number of array elements.


15.S. Mukherjee and C. S. Seelamantula, "Quantization-aware phase retrieval," Special issue on Mathematical
   Optics, Imaging, and Applications, International Journal of Wavelets, Multiresolution, and Information
   Processing (Invited paper), 2020. (IF: 1.276)
   — In this invited paper to a special issue, we addressed for the ﬁrst time the problem of reconstructing a
   signal from the magnitude measurements alone, subject to the realistic constraint of quantization. We

   developed a quantization-aware phase retrieval formalism and an efficient reconstruction algorithm for
   signal reconstruction that gives about 5 to 6 dB higher reconstruction accuracy than the benchmark
   techniques.


                                                                                                              5
16.J. R. Harish Kumar, C. S. Seelamantula, A. Mohan, R. Shetty, T. J. M. Berendschot, and C. A. B. Webers,
    "Automatic analysis of normative retinal oximetry images," PLoS ONE, May 2020. (IF: 3.752)
    — In this paper, we presented an automatic technique for the measurement of oxygen saturation in retinal
    arterioles and venules using dual-wavelength retinal oximetry images. The technique is based on
    segmenting an optic-disc-centered ring-shaped region of interest and subsequent analysis of the oxygen

    saturation levels. The results exhibit high consistency with manual annotations across the dataset indicating
    that the automated technique is an accurate alternative to the manual procedure.

17.J. Sadasivan, S. Mukherjee, and C. S. Seelamantula, "Signal denoising using the minimum-probability-of-
    error criterion," vol. 9, e3, APSIPA Transactions on Signal and Information Processing, Jan. 2020. (IF: 4.00)
    — We considered signal denoising via transform-domain shrinkage based on a novel risk criterion called the

    minimum probability of error (MPE), which measures the probability that the estimated parameter lies
    outside an ε-neighborhood of the true value. The denoising performance of MPE turns out to be better than
    that obtained using the minimum MSE-based approaches formulated within  Stein's unbiased risk
    estimation (SURE) framework, especially in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime.

18.J. R. Harish Kumar, C. S. Seelamantula, Y. S. Kamath, and R. Jampala, "Rim-to-disc ratio outperforms cup-to-

    disc ratio for glaucoma prescreening," Nature Scientiﬁc Reports, 9:7099, 2019. (IF: 4.997)
    — In this trendsetting paper, we presented a novel and fully automated fundus image processing technique
    for glaucoma prescreening based on the rim-to-disc ratio (RDR). We showed the inadequacy of using the
    cup-to-disc ratio (CDR), which was a de facto metric up until this publication. The technique accurately
    segments the optic disc and optic cup and then computes the RDR based on which it is possible to

    differentiate a normal fundus from a moderate, or severely glaucomatous classes following the disc-
    damage-likelihood scale (DDLS). This is the ﬁrst engineering attempt at using RDR and DDLS to perform
    glaucoma severity assessment.

19.J. Sadasivan, C. S. Seelamantula, N. R. Muraka, "Speech enhancement using a risk estimation approach,” vol.
    116, pp. 12-29, Speech Communication, January 2020. (IF: 2.723)

    — In this paper, we developed a risk estimation framework for speech enhancement, wherein we optimize
    an unbiased estimate of the risk instead of the actual risk. Among the risk estimation-based techniques, the
    quality of the denoised speech is higher and is quantiﬁed in terms of speech quality and subjective listening
    scores for perceptual risk-based estimation techniques than the standard mean-square error techniques.

20.H. Sundar, T. V. Sreenivas, and C. S. Seelamantula, “TDOA-based multiple source localization without
    association ambiguity,” IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing, vol. 26, no. 11,

    pp. 1976-1990, November 2018. (IF: 4.364)
    — Multiple source localization using time-differences of arrival (TDOAs) is challenging because of the
    ambiguity involved in associating the TDOAs computed across microphone pairs to the sources. We showed
    that the association ambiguity of the TDOAs can be effectively resolved using the inverse delay interval
    region (IDIR), introduced in this paper. We showed that the direction-of-arrival error is within 2 degrees and

    the spatial localization error is less than 30 cm for a speaker.

21.B. A. Shenoy, S. Mulleti, and C. S. Seelamantula, “On 2-D Hilbert integral equations, generalized minimum-
    phase signals, and phase retrieval,” IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, vol. 66, no. 14, pp. 3906-3917,
    July 15, 2018. (IF: 5.028)
    — One-dimensional (1-D) causal signals admit Hilbert integral relations between the real and imaginary

    parts of their Fourier spectra. For 1-D minimum-phase signals, the log-magnitude and phase spectra also
    admit such Hilbert relations. Such results were not available in 2-D. In this paper, we extend these results to
    2-D signals. We ﬁrst established the Hilbert integral equations for 2-D ﬁrst-quadrant signals. and partial
    Hilbert transform relations between the real and imaginary parts of the spectrum. 

22.S. Mukherjee and C. S. Seelamantula, “Phase retrieval from binary measurements,” IEEE Signal Processing

    Letters, pp. 348-352, vol. 25, no. 3, March 2018. (IF: 3.201)
    — We considered the novel problem of signal reconstruction from quadratic measurements that are binary
    encoded. This publication is the ﬁrst to consider the effect of quantization in the context of phase retrieval.
    Binary measurements are fast to acquire and inexpensive in terms of hardware. For signal reconstruction,
    we employed a consistency criterion and developed a projected gradient-descent scheme with high

    accuracy reconstruction.

                                                                                                                6
   — We showed that among the class of unitary operators that are linear and invariant to translation and

   scale, the fractional Hilbert (FrH) operator is unique for parametrically modeling pulse asymmetry. We
   demonstrate how this key result could be used for sampling a pulse train with variable asymmetry. These
   signals cannot be accommodated in the Shannon sampling framework and therefore, we develop an
   alternative and high-performant sampling scheme.

   longer bouts of gamma rhythm,” vol. 119, pp. 808-821, Journal of Neurophysiology, 2018. (IF: 2.714)

   — Gamma oscillations (30–80 Hz) have been hypothesized to provide a temporal reference frame for
   coordination of spiking activity. Several studies showed that gamma occurs in very short bursts. We
   disproved those claims and provided a robust estimate of the duration. The median duration of gamma is
   greater than 300 ms, much longer than previous estimates — this is a seminal ﬁnding in neuroscience.

   convolutional network,” IEEE Signal Processing Letters, vol. 25, no. 1, pp. 85-89, Jan. 2018. Featured in the

   Top 10 popular articles of the journal for three consecutive months. (IF: 3.201)
   — Our method relies on constructing a dynamic convolutional network (DCN) to learn the relation between
   the consecutive scales of Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids, which is used to predict the detail at a ﬁner
   scale, thus leading to super-resolution. The proposed DCN approach results in about 0.8 and 0.3 dB gain in
   peak signal-to-noise ratio for 2× and 3× super-resolution, respectively.

7.5 Highlights of industry interaction
1. As part of the IMPRINT India Initiative, we developed new image processing algorithms and software for fully
   automated glaucoma analysis and detection, which is critical in prescreening applications. The parameters

   used for prescreening are more clinically pertinent and different from the conventionally deployed cup-to-
   disc ratio metric and offer a signiﬁcantly superior performance. Our software is readily deployable on
   Android and iOS devices. Validations have been conducted independently as well as jointly with fundus-on-

   phone device manufacturers such as Remidio, Forus, and Bosch. Six trial licenses have been granted to M/s.
   Remidio Innovative Solutions Private Limited, Bangalore through the IISc Intellectual Property and
   Technology Licensing office. In collaboration with the Department of Ophthalmology, Kasturba Medical
   College Hospital, Manipal, Karnataka, we have also created an Indian ethnicity speciﬁc glaucoma database.

   This is the ﬁrst-of-its-kind gold standard glaucoma database in the Indian setting, collected from 650
   patients and ﬁve expert doctors provided ground-truth annotations.
2. Our project with HP labs, USA was on the use of inertial sensors for acquiring biosignals in medical

   applications. The objective was to perform signal separation and extract speciﬁc parameters for performing
   classiﬁcation. We also developed algorithms for fall detection using inertial sensor data. The problem of fall
   detection is important in a hospital scenario and home-care for the lonely and elderly.

3. Our project with Texas Instruments (TI), Bangalore is focused on developing sparse array approaches for
   performing super-resolved ultrasound imaging. The hardware platform for executing the project and
   technical support is provided by TI. We developed computationally efficient algorithms keeping the hardware
   constraints in mind. Dr. Chetan Thakur and team (ESE, IISc) developed the hardware. The project is for a

   duration of three years and is funded by the Semiconductor Research Corporation, which is a world-class
   technology research consortium.
4. Our project with The Boeing Company, USA is focused on developing a benchmark database and associated

   AI algorithms for foreign object detection and surface irregularity identiﬁcation, particularly for mission-
   critical applications. The foreign objects may be found in highly vulnerable areas such as the fuel tank of an
   airplane where it is not always feasible for a human to enter into for examination. We created a benchmark
   dataset that can be used for validation of various AI algorithms and also developed a suite of explainable AI

   algorithms for foreign object detection.
5. Our project with Carl Zeiss Bangalore Privated Limited is aimed at developing a state-of-the-art AI engine
   both for classiﬁcation of various retinal pathologies from optical-coherence tomography images. The deep

   learning models also provide a means of assessing and visualizing what parts of the image gave rise to the
   desired classiﬁcation outcome and determining whether those are also clinically relevant. The techniques
   developed also led to accurate computation of the retinal ﬂuid volume. This translational research project

   involves working closely with doctors and incorporating their feedback to reﬁne the machine learning
   models, thereby improving their reliability and deployability.
